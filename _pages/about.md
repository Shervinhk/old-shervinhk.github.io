Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I'm Shervin Hakimi. I enjoy using mathematics in practical machine-learning applications. Born in Tehran and raised in contrasting landscapes—from a tranquil small town in the north to the dynamic capital.

My professional journey spans several projects from designing algorithms to control wheelchairs using EEG signals, [predicting mood relapses in bipolar patients in Prague](https://mindpax.me/), [extending a mathematical model of the kidney through partial differential equations](https://github.com/Layton-Lab/nephron-calcium), and [employing machine learning and deep learning to analyze health records of over 100,000 diabetic patients for early chronic kidney disease prediction](https://diabetesaction.ca/repository/).

I earned my Master’s in Mathematics (MMath) in Applied Mathematics from the University of Waterloo, a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology.

Outside of mathematics and engineering, I enjoy learning new languages (fluent in German, Persian, English and French), photography, travelling and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13302370-shervin-hakimi).  

Feel free to reach out via [email](s3hakimi@uwaterloo.ca) — I'm always open to interesting conversations and potential collaborations.

I'm Shervin Hakimi. I enjoy using mathematics in practical machine-learning applications. Born in Tehran and raised in contrasting landscapes—from a tranquil small town in the north to the dynamic capital.

My professional journey has been rich with opportunities to apply my mathematical acumen in machine learning contexts. From developing algorithms that control wheelchairs using EEG signals to pioneering predictive models for chronic disease management, my work consistently bridges complex mathematics with real-world applications. These experiences not only showcase my technical skills but also my dedication to making a tangible impact through technology.

With a Master’s in Applied Mathematics from the University of Waterloo and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, my education has been pivotal in shaping my approach to machine learning. It's here that I learned to balance theoretical knowledge with practical problem-solving, a skill I bring to every project I undertake.

When not immersed in data and algorithms, my interests span learning new languages—I'm fluent in German, Persian, English, and French—and exploring the world through photography. These pursuits complement my professional life, providing new perspectives and a continual source of inspiration.

Feel free to reach out via email — I'm always open to interesting conversations and potential collaborations. Whether it’s a new project idea or a deep dive into the latest in machine learning, I’m here for it.
